Q4. In your own words (short paragraphs conveying your thoughts), answer the following questions:
  a. What is refactoring? When and why should you refactor?
  b. What is testing? When and why should you write test cases?

a. What is refactoring? When and why should you refactor?
Ans: Refactoring is the process of changing an application's source code without changing the application's functionality behavior. The purpose of refactoring is to polish up the application source code to be more readable, maintainable, scalable and complex. The best timing to consider refactoring is before including in any updates or new features to the existing application source code. 

b. What is testing? When and why should you write test cases?
Ans: Testing is a way to check and evalute whether the application is functioning as what its supposed to. The purpose of writing test cases is to iron out application bugs so that defects can be identified and corrected. The best timing to write test cases is when requirements are gathered or the requirements are as complete as possible before the commencement of the development phrase.
